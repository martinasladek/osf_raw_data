(Not at all easier)","PRE-PANDEMIC: I washed my hands (only my hands, not whole body) for up to 45-minutes before entering any ""clean"" (sanitized) areas of my home. If I exit the clean areas or go outside, even for a few minutes, I re-do the hand washing process. DURING PANDEMIC: I feel myself having the STRONG urge to completely shower before entering the clean areas of my home. I have given into this compulsion too many times, and it is ruining my life because it is so time consuming. I never thought I would get to this point. I was actually doing SO WELL prior to the pandemic. I was reducing my washing time and I was feeling less SUDS when touching ""dirty"" things. Now I don't even want to do ERP exposures anymore because I feel like the threat of disease is real. Before the pandemic, I at least had awareness that my obsessions were nonsense. I knew there was a slight risk of getting sick (like the flu or a cold), but I knew my compulsions were unnecessary. Because of the pandemic, it now feels like ALL of my compulsions are justified. I see ""normal"" people using copious amounts of hand sanitizer and washing furiously... and it makes me have a really difficult being motivated to do ERP exposures to reduce my decontaminating because now I feel that the compulsions are actually necessary. This is a nightmare. The increased washing is only the tip of the iceberg. It's harder for me to do basically anything outside my home now. I was excelling at my ERP exposures before COVID. I had even gotten to the point where I could eat at restaurants without using hand sanitizer. (Before that exposure, I was using 8 ""rounds"" of hand sanitizer before eating at restaurants. NOW I go out in public with latex gloves on, and then still do all my washing compulsions when I get home. I feel like all my progress has been ruined.)","The only ""easy"" thing is that for the past decade, I have avoided touching high-touch surfaces (doorknobs, elevator buttons, ATM machines, gas pumps, etc.). So it is easy for me to avoid touching these things bc it's already a habit. Also, I have not touched my face outside my home with ""dirty"" (unsanitized) hands since about 10 years ago. So the CDC recommends not touching your face due to COVID-19 -- and that is no problem for me bc I haven't done so in a decade. (I would know if I accidentally touched my face bc I'd experience about a 70 SUDS from it.)","There is a shortage of Clorox wipes in my town. I used to use about 15 per day, pre-pandemic. (This was a great improvement, as I used to use about 45 per day in 2011.) I have had to ration them to 1 per day. This has caused debilitating anxiety. I try not to watch the news because it exacerbates my contamination symptoms. (Contamination and relationship jealousy are my two main OCD ""themes,"" with contamination being the worse ""theme.""

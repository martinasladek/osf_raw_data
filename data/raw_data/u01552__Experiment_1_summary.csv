4,23,male,2020-06-03_16:31:30,7,1,1,3,0,0,7,very little. I did take a short bathroom break around halfway and a short break inbetween 1 and 2; but it was mostly successive sessions. Sometimes a few deep breaths inbetween sessions. I did the final 6 all in a row with no break at all.;,The blue ones caused a spike in attention and maybe stress; I answered those ones faster and with less accuracy. It'd feel devastating getting those wrong haha.\nI'd even correctly identify which orientation and reflexively hit the wrong button; that would be frustrating; I had cursed a few times.\n\nI felt somewhat emotionally attached to the icons used for the medals; since they are identical to the ones used in League of Legends; which I was a diamond rank in when I used to play it. I was very emotionally attached to that diamond medal. It certainly added to the satisfaction; increased motivation and decreased boredom.

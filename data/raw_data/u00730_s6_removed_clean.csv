A3V1VK1A3NYN17,"We were going out to dinner because we had not seen each other for awhile. While we were waiting, his was on his phone, I thought because we were just waiting. But after being seated he still paid more attention to his phone than he did to our conversation. I was quite annoyed but I didn't say anything. He was on his phone 90% of the whole dinner.",1,1,2,1,2,2,-3,-3,-2,-2,-1,Male,29,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-1.5,-2.5
A50K26F2IS94U,"They're a coworker of mine, and we decided to go out to a fast food place during our lunch break. They were fairly new to the workplace, and we had never actually had lunch before together, or even chatted much. It seemed like a nice opportunity to get to know each other. But, after we got our food and sat down, they almost immediately pulled out their phone and had their head bent down over it. They did talk with me a bit, but I could tell that I didn't have their full attention. They didn't give very long responses, and didn't seem very interested in being with me.",1,2,2,2,1,2,-3,-3,-3,-3,-3,Male,32,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-3,-3
ASVRLMDNQBUD9,On a special day out where I took this person out to celebrate at an expensive restaurant because it was our anniversary. She spent most of the time on facebook and messaging with her friends. Taking pictures and posting things on her phone instead of really talking to me much. Also ignoring me when I ask if we could spend the time together instead of using our phones. It really killed the whole romantic feel of the night.,1,1,2,1,2,2,-3,-3,-2,-1,-3,Male,41,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-2,-2.5
A2HFVL6GHX9R9V,"We were watching a movie together and they spent some of the time on their phone. We both hadn't had much time that week to spend together, so we both decided we wanted to do at least something together. We decided on a movie that we wanted to see. After getting about 20 minutes in, I noticed that they started to check their phone. They stayed on their phone for a lot of the movie and it was like they were hardly paying attention. It bothered me quite a bit because I thought they wanted to see the movie and that they were interested in it. But it seemed they would rather be on their phone and not very present in the situation.",1,2,1,1,2,2,-3,-2,-1,-2,-3,Male,23,5,1,1,,6,other_you,-2.5,-1.5
A3TBG0S2IEBVHU,"I was watching a movie with Leslie. It was one I really wanted her to see because its a favorite. I was excited to see what she thought, but she wasn't even paying attention. She kept looking at her phone the whole time and missed the whole movie. It really upset me.",1,2,1,1,2,2,-3,-3,-3,-3,-3,Male,40,5,3,1,,6,other_you,-3,-3
A1JHIT5H2JAHXT,"Jessi, my partner, does this quite a bit.  Almost every night as we wind down after our days on the couch, she's pretty glued to her phones.  A large portion of the time, I  would say about 80% of the time, she's playing games.  I try to engage her in conversation multiple times throughout the night.  It's generally met with short, curt answers.  It's not really a fun time.  Generally due to this, I end up doing just this.  Using Amazon Mturk platform to kill time, and make some money.

A2VLK57ZQ2YI28,"I was walking along the lakefront with a coworker. We were talking about life in general and work, after our work shift had ended. But she was on her phone for much of the time. I felt kind of embarassed, because there were other people around who probably noticed this. At times it felt like talking to a wall, and I felt sad.",1,1,2,1,1,2,-3,-3,-3,-3,-3,Male,29,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-3,-3

AI9QOT5C5DN1P,"It was a lunch about two weeks ago during the workday. He was on the phone for a lot of the time as his sales was struggling that day. They wanted his help so they wouldn't lose any sales and it was his instructions. I mean overall I don't mind that he had to do that and I understood. He was apologizing for it and I said ""look if my team was struggling I would do the same"", I feel he was grateful I understood.",1,2,2,2,1,1,0,-1,0,-1,-1,Male,37,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-1,-0.5
A1ODA3Q5H6HTDQ,We were watching a movie at home and he'd just gotten off the computer from playing different games with his friends. I'd been super excited to see this and we'd practically waited all week until a night off to watch it. But he was on his phone on Discord talking with the same people he'd just gotten done playing games with for hours. It was frustrating and wasn't the first time something like that had happened.,1,2,1,1,1,2,-2,-1,-1,-3,-2,Female,31,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-2.5,-1
A2OVX9UW5WANQE,I was out with Fred on a date. We were playing music on the jukebox so he used his phone for that. After choosing songs to play he kept looking at the App. He was looking at what others had played and where his songs were in the queue. It made me feel ignored seeing him so distracted.,1,2,2,1,1,1,-3,-2,-1,-3,-3,Female,48,5,2,1,,6,other_you,-3,-1.5
